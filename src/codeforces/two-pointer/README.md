|  381A    |  [here](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/381/A)    |   We initialize one pointer `start` at the beginign of the array and another pointer at the end of the array and keep taking the bigger number of two and decrement/increment end/start accodingly. Meanwhile, we also add the bigger value either to `Sereja's` sum or `Dima's` sum. We keep doing this till end becomes lesser than start and finally we print both the counts.       |   [here](https://github.com/MayukhSobo/Algorithms/blob/master/src/codeforces/two-pointer/800/381A.cpp)   |      Time: `O(n)`  Space: `O(1)`      |
